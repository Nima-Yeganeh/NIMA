ISO/IEC 42001:2023 introduces a comprehensive framework for managing records within the context of Incident Management Systems (IMS), emphasizing the critical role of records in enhancing the effectiveness, reliability, and learnability of incident management processes. At its core, the standard defines records as documented information that provides evidence of activities, decisions, or findings. This encompasses a wide range of data, including but not limited to, incident reports, action plans, lessons learned, and improvements made to the IMS.

The standard mandates that records must be accurate, complete, and readily accessible to authorized personnel, underscoring the importance of systematic procedures for capturing, recording, and updating this information. This requirement necessitates the implementation of robust record management systems (RMS) capable of handling the entire lifecycle of records, from creation through storage, retrieval, and eventual disposal.

Moreover, ISO/IEC 42001:2023 highlights the necessity of protecting records from unauthorized access, alteration, or loss, advocating for stringent security measures to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of the information contained within. This includes the use of encryption, access controls, and regular backups to mitigate risks associated with data breaches or loss.

The standard also encourages the integration of technology into record management processes, promoting the adoption of Electronic Document Management Systems (EDMS) to streamline operations and reduce manual errors. However, it cautions against the mere substitution of paper records with digital ones without considering the implications for accessibility, usability, and long-term preservation of the information.

ISO/IEC 42001:2023 delineates clear roles and responsibilities regarding records, emphasizing that all personnel involved in incident management have a duty to contribute to the creation, maintenance, and utilization of records. This extends beyond those directly engaged in incident response to include support staff, such as IT professionals tasked with managing RMS and executives overseeing the overall documentation strategy.

In summary, ISO/IEC 42001:2023 positions records as a cornerstone of an efficient and effective IMS, prescribing detailed practices for their management to ensure transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement. By adhering to the standards outlined, organizations can bolster their resilience against incidents, comply with regulatory requirements, and foster a culture of safety and learning.
