The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) stack and its components form the foundation of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communications, enabling the initiation, maintenance, modification, and termination of multimedia sessions such as voice, video, and messaging. At the core of the SIP stack is the User Agent Client (UAC), which initiates requests to start, modify, or terminate calls, and the User Agent Server (UAS), which receives these requests and responds accordingly. Between them, the UAC and UAS communicate through the SIP protocol, exchanging messages that define the session parameters, including the media types, codecs, and transport protocols. Above the UAC and UAS lies the Transaction Layer, responsible for managing the exchange of individual SIP messages between the client and server. This layer ensures that each request is properly acknowledged and that any errors are handled efficiently. The Transaction Layer relies on the Transport Layer, which can utilize various protocols like TCP, UDP, or SCTP to deliver SIP messages across the network. This layer is crucial for ensuring the reliability and orderliness of message delivery. The Application Layer interacts with the application-specific logic, providing interfaces for applications to initiate, control, and terminate sessions. It includes components like the Registrar, which handles address registration; the Redirect Server, which redirects incoming requests to alternative destinations; and the Proxy Server, which routes requests on behalf of the UAC. The Proxy Server can be further categorized into stateful (requesting responses to specific requests) and stateless (forwarding requests without tracking their state). Finally, the topmost layer consists of the application itself, which could be a softphone, a web browser, or any device capable of initiating or receiving SIP messages. This layer is where the end-user interface resides, allowing users to interact with the SIP functionality through graphical interfaces or command-line tools.
