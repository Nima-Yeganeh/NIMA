Amazon EC2: Core of AWS Cloud Computing
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a foundational service in AWS that provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud. This document covers key aspects of EC2 including instance types, purchasing options, features, and exam tips for AWS certification candidates. Understanding EC2 is crucial for anyone looking to leverage AWS for cloud computing needs or prepare for AWS certification exams.

##########
##########

Overview of Amazon EC2
Amazon EC2 allows users to rent virtual servers, known as instances, in the cloud. This service provides resizable compute capacity, enabling businesses to quickly scale up or down based on their computing requirements. EC2 is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers and IT professionals.
EC2 instances can run various operating systems, including multiple flavors of Linux and Windows Server. Users have full control over their instances and can interact with them as they would with any machine. This flexibility makes EC2 suitable for a wide range of applications, from web servers and application servers to databases and big data processing.

##########
##########

EC2 Instance Types: General Purpose
General Purpose instances are designed to provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. They are suitable for a wide range of workloads, including web servers, small databases, and development environments. The T3 and M5 series are popular choices in this category.
T3 instances are burstable performance instances that provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline. This makes them ideal for workloads with variable CPU usage. M5 instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and network resources, making them a good choice for many applications.
T3 Series
Burstable performance instances Baseline CPU with ability to burst Ideal for variable workloads Cost-effective for many use cases
M5 Series
Balanced compute, memory, and network Fixed performance (non-burstable) Suitable for a wide range of applications Good for medium-sized databases
T3a and M5a Series
AMD EPYC processor-based instances Lower cost option compared to Intel Similar capabilities to T3 and M5 Good for cost-sensitive workloads

##########

EC2 Instance Types: Compute Optimized
Compute Optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high performance processors. These instances are well-suited for batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers. The C5 series is a popular choice in this category.
C5 instances feature high-performance Intel Xeon Scalable processors (Skylake or Cascade Lake) and offer a high ratio of vCPUs to memory. They also provide enhanced networking capabilities with up to 100 Gbps of network bandwidth, making them ideal for compute-intensive and network-intensive applications.

##########
##########

EC2 Instance Types: Memory Optimized
Memory Optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. These instances are ideal for memory-intensive applications such as high-performance databases, distributed memory caches, and real-time big data analytics. The R5 series is a prominent choice in this category.
R5 instances feature Intel Xeon Platinum 8000 series processors and offer a high ratio of memory to vCPU. They provide up to 768 GiB of memory per instance, making them suitable for memory-intensive enterprise applications, large-scale SAP workloads, and big data processing engines like Apache Spark or Presto.

##########
##########

EC2 Instance Types: Storage Optimized
Storage Optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications. The I3 and D2 series are popular choices in this category.
I3 instances are optimized for low latency, very high random I/O performance, and high sequential read throughput. They are ideal for NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and Elasticsearch. D2 instances feature high-density HDD storage and are designed for applications that require high sequential I/O access to large datasets, such as data warehousing and distributed file systems.

##########
##########

EC2 Instance Types: Accelerated Computing
Accelerated Computing instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. These instances are ideal for workloads such as machine learning, high-performance computing, and financial modeling. The P3 and G4 series are notable choices in this category.
P3 instances are equipped with NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs and are designed for machine learning, high-performance computing, and computational fluid dynamics. G4 instances feature NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs and are optimized for machine learning inference and graphics-intensive applications like remote graphics workstations, game streaming, and video transcoding.

##########
##########

EC2 Purchasing Options: On-Demand Instances
On-Demand Instances allow you to pay for compute capacity by the second, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. They offer maximum flexibility as you can start or stop instances at any time. This option is ideal for short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
With On-Demand Instances, you're charged only for the compute time you use. This pricing model is particularly useful for developing and testing applications, running applications with unpredictable usage patterns, or for workloads that cannot be interrupted. It's also a good choice for first-time or experimental workloads in EC2.

##########
##########

EC2 Purchasing Options: Reserved Instances
Reserved Instances (RIs) provide a significant discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand pricing and provide a capacity reservation when used in a specific Availability Zone. RIs are available in 1-year or 3-year terms, with the longer term offering greater savings. They are best suited for applications with steady-state usage.
There are three types of RIs: Standard RIs, Convertible RIs, and Scheduled RIs. Standard RIs offer the highest discount but can only be modified, not exchanged. Convertible RIs provide flexibility to change the instance family, OS, or tenancy, but at a lower discount. Scheduled RIs are available to launch within the time windows you reserve, which is ideal for predictable recurring schedules.
Choose RI Type
Decide between Standard, Convertible, or Scheduled RIs based on your flexibility needs and discount preferences.
Select Term Length
Choose between 1-year or 3-year terms. Longer terms offer higher discounts but require a longer commitment.
Determine Payment Option
Choose All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront payment. The more you pay upfront, the higher the discount.
Apply RI to Instances
RIs are automatically applied to running instances that match the specified parameters, providing immediate cost savings.

##########
##########

EC2 Purchasing Options: Spot Instances
Spot Instances allow you to request spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off the On-Demand price. These instances are ideal for applications with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions. Spot Instances are particularly useful for big data, containerized workloads, CI/CD, web servers, high-performance computing (HPC), and other test and development workloads.
The catch with Spot Instances is that they can be interrupted with a 2-minute notification when EC2 needs the capacity back. To mitigate this, you can use Spot Fleet, which allows you to request a target capacity across various instance types, potentially reducing the impact of interruptions. It's crucial to design your applications to be fault-tolerant and stateless when using Spot Instances.

##########
##########

EC2 Purchasing Options: Savings Plans
Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that offers lower prices on EC2 and Fargate usage in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or 3-year term. This model provides savings of up to 72% compared to On-Demand rates, similar to Reserved Instances, but with more flexibility.
There are two types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans and EC2 Instance Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans provide the most flexibility, applying to EC2 instance usage regardless of instance family, size, AZ, region, or OS, and also to Fargate usage. EC2 Instance Savings Plans are more restrictive, applying to a specific instance family in a chosen region, but offer slightly higher discounts.

##########
##########

Key Feature: Auto Scaling
Auto Scaling is a key feature of EC2 that allows you to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in a group based on defined conditions. This ensures that you have the right number of instances available to handle your application's load, helping to maintain performance and minimize costs.
Auto Scaling uses CloudWatch metrics to determine when to scale in (remove instances) or scale out (add instances). You can set up scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization, network traffic, or custom application-specific metrics. Auto Scaling also performs health checks on instances and can replace unhealthy instances automatically, enhancing the reliability and availability of your applications.
Define Auto Scaling Group
Specify the minimum, maximum, and desired number of EC2 instances.
Create Scaling Policy
Set conditions for scaling based on metrics like CPU utilization or network traffic.
Monitor and Adjust
Auto Scaling continuously monitors and adjusts the number of instances based on the policy.
Maintain Performance
Ensures optimal performance and cost-efficiency as demand fluctuates.

##########
##########

Key Feature: Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones, enhancing the fault tolerance of your applications.
AWS offers three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, Network Load Balancer (NLB) for TCP/UDP traffic, and Classic Load Balancer for basic load balancing across multiple EC2 instances. ELB works seamlessly with Auto Scaling to ensure that your application can handle varying levels of traffic while maintaining high availability.

##########
##########

Key Feature: Security Groups
Security Groups act as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. They operate at the instance level and can be associated with multiple instances. Security Groups are stateful, meaning if you allow inbound traffic on a port, the corresponding outbound traffic is automatically allowed.
You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules. All inbound traffic is blocked by default unless a rule specifically allows it, while all outbound traffic is allowed by default. Security Groups can reference other Security Groups, IP ranges, or specific IP addresses. This feature is crucial for implementing the principle of least privilege and ensuring your EC2 instances are properly secured.

##########
##########

Key Feature: Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are an additional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. Unlike Security Groups, NACLs are stateless and operate at the subnet level. This means you must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound traffic.
NACLs allow you to create both allow and deny rules. Rules are evaluated in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule. Once a rule matches traffic, it's immediately applied regardless of any higher-numbered rule that may contradict it. This makes NACLs powerful for creating more complex network security policies, especially when used in conjunction with Security Groups.

##########
##########

Key Feature: Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. EBS volumes are network-attached storage that persists independently from the life of an instance. They are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance in the same Availability Zone.
EBS offers several volume types optimized for different use cases: General Purpose SSD (gp2 and gp3), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2), Throughput Optimized HDD (st1), and Cold HDD (sc1). These volumes can be encrypted, allowing you to meet security and compliance requirements. EBS also supports snapshots, enabling point-in-time backups of your data that can be restored to new volumes.
General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3)
Balances price and performance for a wide variety of transactional workloads.
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2)
Designed for I/O-intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases.
Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
Low-cost HDD volume for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads.
Cold HDD (sc1)
Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads.

##########
##########

Key Feature: Elastic IP Addresses
Elastic IP addresses are static, public IPv4 addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account, and you can quickly remap it to another instance in your account, masking the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance.
Elastic IPs are particularly useful for applications that require a fixed IP address, such as hosting websites or running mail servers. They also play a crucial role in implementing high availability architectures, allowing you to quickly redirect traffic to a standby instance in case of a failure. However, it's important to note that you're charged for an Elastic IP address if it's not associated with a running instance, encouraging efficient use of these resources.

##########

Understanding EC2 Use Cases
Amazon EC2 is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications. For web applications with variable traffic, a combination of On-Demand and Reserved Instances with Auto Scaling can provide cost-effective scalability. For big data processing jobs that can withstand interruptions, Spot Instances can offer significant cost savings.
Reserved Instances are ideal for applications with predictable, steady-state usage, such as enterprise applications or databases. On-Demand Instances are suitable for short-term projects, testing environments, or unpredictable workloads. Understanding these use cases is crucial for effective resource management and cost optimization in AWS.
Web Hosting
EC2 instances running web servers, load balanced for high availability.
Big Data Processing
Large-scale data processing using EC2 for distributed computing frameworks.
Enterprise Applications
EC2 hosting mission-critical enterprise applications with high reliability.

##########
##########

EC2 Pricing Models: Cost Implications
Understanding the cost implications of different EC2 purchasing options is crucial for optimizing your AWS spending. On-Demand Instances offer the highest flexibility but at the highest per-hour cost. Reserved Instances provide significant discounts (up to 72%) for steady-state workloads but require upfront commitments.
Spot Instances can offer up to 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices, but come with the risk of interruption. Savings Plans provide a balance of discount (up to 72%) and flexibility. When designing your architecture, consider using a mix of these options to optimize for both performance and cost. For example, use Reserved Instances for your base load, On-Demand for predictable variations, and Spot for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads.

##########
##########

Security Groups vs Network ACLs
Understanding the differences between Security Groups and Network ACLs is crucial for implementing effective security in your EC2 environment. Security Groups are stateful and operate at the instance level, while Network ACLs are stateless and operate at the subnet level. This means that Security Groups automatically allow return traffic, while Network ACLs require explicit allow rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.
Security Groups only support allow rules, making them simpler to manage but potentially less flexible for complex security requirements. Network ACLs support both allow and deny rules, providing more granular control. In practice, it's common to use both: Security Groups for instance-level security and Network ACLs for an additional layer of defense at the subnet level.

Configuring Auto Scaling Policies
Auto Scaling policies define how your Auto Scaling group responds to changing demand. There are several types of scaling policies: Simple scaling responds to a single metric, Step scaling allows you to set multiple steps based on the size of the alarm breach, Target tracking automatically adjusts capacity to maintain a specific metric at a target value, and Scheduled scaling allows you to scale based on predictable load changes.
When configuring Auto Scaling policies, it's important to consider your application's behavior and requirements. Set appropriate cooldown periods to prevent rapid scaling events, and use appropriate metrics that accurately reflect your application's load. Common metrics include CPU utilization, network I/O, and application-specific metrics pushed to CloudWatch. Always test your scaling policies thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected under various load conditions.

##########
##########

Implementing High Availability with EC2
Achieving high availability with EC2 involves distributing your application across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. This protects against localized failures, such as power outages or network issues. Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across instances in multiple AZs, and configure Auto Scaling to maintain a minimum number of healthy instances in each AZ.
For stateful applications, consider using multi-AZ deployments of Amazon RDS for database high availability. Implement regular backups and test your disaster recovery procedures. Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting, and consider using AWS Systems Manager for automated instance management and maintenance. Remember that true high availability often requires both infrastructure-level redundancy and application-level design for fault tolerance.

##########
##########

EC2 Instance Lifecycle
Understanding the EC2 instance lifecycle is crucial for effective management of your compute resources. An instance transitions through different states from the moment you launch it until its termination. The main states are: pending, running, stopping, stopped, and terminated. When you launch an instance, it enters the pending state, then the running state when it's ready for use.
You can stop and start an instance if you need to change its instance type or troubleshoot an issue. When you stop an instance, it enters the stopping state, then the stopped state. In the stopped state, you're not charged for instance usage, but you are charged for attached EBS volumes. When you terminate an instance, it enters the shutting-down state, then the terminated state. Once terminated, an instance cannot be recovered, so be cautious when terminating instances.
Launch
Instance enters pending state, then transitions to running.
Use
Instance is in running state, ready for use.
Stop (Optional)
Instance enters stopping state, then stopped state.
Terminate
Instance enters shutting-down state, then terminated.

##########

EC2 Instance Metadata and User Data
EC2 Instance Metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance. It's available at http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ and can be accessed from within the instance. This metadata includes information such as the instance ID, public IP address, security groups, and more. It's a valuable resource for scripts and applications running on the instance to obtain information about their environment.
User Data, on the other hand, is data that you can provide to the instance at launch time. It's typically used to perform common automated configuration tasks or run scripts after the instance starts. This can include installing software, updating configurations, or mounting additional storage volumes. User Data is limited to 16 KB and is executed only at the launch of the instance. Both Instance Metadata and User Data are powerful tools for automating instance configuration and management in EC2.

##########
##########

EC2 Placement Groups
EC2 Placement Groups allow you to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload. There are three types of placement groups: Cluster, Spread, and Partition. Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency and high network throughput. All instances are placed in the same Availability Zone on the same underlying hardware.
Spread placement groups are designed for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other. Instances are placed on distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures. Partition placement groups are useful for large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka. Instances are grouped into logical partitions, ensuring that each partition has its own set of racks with independent network and power sources.
Cluster
Low latency, high throughput
Spread
Maximum availability and reliability
Partition
Large distributed workloads

##########
##########

EC2 Instance Store vs EBS
EC2 Instance Store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance Store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, or scratch data. The key characteristic of Instance Store volumes is that they persist only during the lifetime of the associated EC2 instance. If the instance is stopped or terminated, all data on the Instance Store is lost.
In contrast, Amazon EBS provides persistent block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are network-attached storage that persists independently from the life of an instance. They are highly available and reliable, and can be attached to any running instance in the same Availability Zone. EBS is suitable for data that must persist and be accessible beyond the lifetime of a single EC2 instance, such as databases or long-term storage of files. EBS also supports features like snapshots for backup and encryption for enhanced security.

##########
##########

EC2 Networking: Enhanced Networking
Enhanced Networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. Enhanced Networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies.
There are two mechanisms for enabling Enhanced Networking: Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) and Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) interface. ENA supports network speeds of up to 100 Gbps and is used with newer EC2 instance types. The Intel 82599 VF interface supports network speeds of up to 10 Gbps and is used with older instance types. When launching an instance that supports Enhanced Networking, it is automatically enabled. Enhanced Networking is particularly beneficial for high-performance computing, real-time processing, and other network-intensive workloads.

##########
##########

EC2 Hibernate
EC2 Hibernate is a feature that allows you to pause your EC2 instance and resume it later, picking up exactly where you left off. When you hibernate an instance, the operating system is instructed to perform hibernation, which saves the contents of the instance memory (RAM) to the EBS root volume. When you start the instance again, the RAM contents are reloaded, and the instance resumes where it left off.
Hibernate is particularly useful for long-running processes or applications that take time to initialize. It can significantly reduce instance start time for applications that require a lengthy bootstrap process. However, there are some limitations: the instance RAM size must be less than 150 GB, certain instance families are not supported, and the root volume must be an EBS volume and large enough to store the RAM contents. Hibernate is not supported for all operating systems, so check the AWS documentation for compatibility before using this feature.

##########
##########

EC2 Nitro System
The AWS Nitro System is the underlying platform for the next generation of EC2 instances. It is a collection of AWS-built hardware and software components that enable high performance, high availability, and high security. The Nitro System provides bare metal-like performance with the elasticity and scalability of virtual machines.
Key components of the Nitro System include the Nitro Card for VPC and EBS I/O, Nitro Security Chip for offloading and isolating security functions, and Nitro Hypervisor for memory and CPU allocation. Instances running on the Nitro System benefit from improved performance, enhanced security, and faster instance launch times. They also support new features like Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for high-performance computing and machine learning applications. When selecting instance types for performance-critical applications, consider choosing Nitro-based instances for the best possible performance and latest features.
