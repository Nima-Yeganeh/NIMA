# Use an official Nginx base image
FROM nginx:latest

# Copy custom configuration file to the container
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Copy static content (e.g., a website) to the default Nginx public directory
COPY ./static-content /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the default Nginx port
EXPOSE 80

# CMD is not necessary as the base Nginx image already specifies it
